## Step 3: Verify Your Seed Phrase

* You’ll be given a **seed phrase**, which is a set of **24 words** that acts as your backup key. Showing it for demo purpose. <mark style="color:red;">**DO NOT SHOW ANYONE YOUR KEY**</mark><mark style="color:red;">.</mark>
* **Write these down** carefully on paper. This is crucial, as losing the seed phrase means losing access to your funds.
* **Verify** your seed phrase by entering the words in the correct order. This step ensures you’ve written it down correctly.

**Notice**

* **Keep Your Seed Phrase Safe**: Never store your seed phrase digitally (on your phone or computer). Always store it offline, such as on paper, to avoid the risk of hacking.
* **Double-check Addresses**: When transferring funds from an exchange, make sure you select the correct **TON blockchain** and enter your Tonkeeper address carefully to avoid errors.
* **Don't spend all your Toncoin!** You'll need to save some to cover gas fees for transactions.

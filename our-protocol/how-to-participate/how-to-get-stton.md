# How to Get stTON

**stTON** is another Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) token offered through [Bemo Finance](https://bemo.finance/). Here’s how to get it:

1. Visit [Bemo Finance](https://bemo.finance/) and connect your Tonkeeper wallet.
2. Deposit your **Toncoin (TON)** into Bemo.
3. You’ll receive **stTON** in exchange for your deposited TON. This means your TON is staked, earning rewards, while **stTON** remains **liquid**, allowing you to use it in DeFi projects.

**stTON** gives you the flexibility to participate in other DeFi opportunities while still benefiting from staking rewards.

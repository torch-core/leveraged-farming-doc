1. Open the **Torlympics app**.
2. Tap on the **Yield** icon, which looks like a trending arrow at the bottom of the screen.
3. You will land on the **Farming page**. Tap the button labeled "**I'm ready to farm**" to connect your wallet and enter the main **Farming** interface.

## Step 2: Invite more to earn more later

On this page, you will see the earnings for **rebates** and **discounts** displayed. By default:

* When you invite someone, you will receive a **5% rebate** on their farming profits.
* When you use someone’s invite code, you will get a **5% additional discount**.

These **rebates** and **discounts** won’t be applied automatically during the process. Instead, the accumulated rewards will be **distributed separately** at a later time. So, the more people you invite, the more rewards you’ll earn later!

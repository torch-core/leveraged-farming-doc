# ðŸ’¡ Introduction

The **Saving Account** offers a safe and passive way to earn interest by lending your assets to the lending pool. Unlike more complex strategies like leveraged yield farming, Saving Accounts are designed for users who want steady returns without actively managing their positions. By providing assets like **USDT, tsTON, and stTON** to the lending pool, you can earn interest as Farmers borrow your funds to use in their farming strategies.

This is an ideal option for users looking for low-risk, hands-off growth of their assets while still participating in the DeFi ecosystem.

# ðŸš¨ Risks

While **Saving Accounts** offer a relatively safer way to earn steady interest by lending your assets, there are still certain risks to be aware of:

## **Utilization Risk**

If the **lending pool** utilization becomes too high, meaning a large portion of the assets are borrowed, it may be difficult to **withdraw** your funds immediately. You might need to wait for the borrowed assets to be returned before being able to withdraw your assets.

## **Interest Rate Fluctuations**

The interest rate you earn is dependent on the borrowing demand. If fewer Farmers borrow from the pool, the **interest rate may drop**, resulting in lower returns for Lenders. On the flip side, high demand may increase interest rates, but also delay withdrawals due to high utilization.



## :detective: How to Protect Yourself

1. **Monitor Pool Utilization**:\
   Keep an eye on how much of the pool is being borrowed. High utilization might delay withdrawals.
2. **Diversify**:\
   Spread your assets across different pools to reduce risk.
3. **Watch Interest Rates**:\
   Check the interest rates regularly. If they drop, consider moving your assets to better-performing pools.

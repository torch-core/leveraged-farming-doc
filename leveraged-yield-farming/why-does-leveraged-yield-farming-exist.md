# ðŸŒ² Why Does Leveraged Yield Farming Exist

In decentralized finance (DeFi), users help facilitate token trading by providing liquidity to liquidity pools (LPs). In return, they earn rewards from trading fees and other incentives. Leveraged Yield Farming (LYF) allows you to borrow assets to increase your farming position, meaning you can earn more rewards with a bigger deposit.

## What is a Liquidity Pool (LP)?

A **Liquidity Pool** is a collection of tokens used for trading between different assets. When you deposit into the pool, you provide liquidity and receive **LP tokens** representing your share of the pool. These LP tokens entitle you to a portion of the rewards generated by trading activity in the pool.

## Why Are Rewards Given to Liquidity Providers?

Platforms like [**DeDust**](https://dedust.io) or [**STON.fi**](http://ston.fi) offer **TON rewards** to incentivize users to provide liquidity to their pools. The reason for this is simple: without enough liquidity, users wouldnâ€™t be able to trade tokens smoothly, and the platform wouldnâ€™t function well. To ensure that thereâ€™s always enough liquidity in the pool, the platform allocates rewards (in this case, **TON coins**) to liquidity providers.

#### These rewards come from two main sources:

1. **Trading fees**: A small fee is taken from each trade, which goes to liquidity providers.
2. **Platform incentives**: The platform or protocol itself might offer additional rewards (like **TON coins**) to further incentivize users to provide liquidity.

By offering rewards, platforms can attract more liquidity providers, ensuring the pools remain healthy and functional.

# ðŸŒ¾ Farming Strategies

Thereâ€™s a simple way to start earning rewards: just **deposit** into pools that offer rewards, like the **stTON/USDT pool**, and begin farming. However, if you're looking to **maximize your earnings**, thereâ€™s a more advanced option called **leveraged yield farming**. Letâ€™s break down the differences between regular farming and using **leveraged yield farming**.

## Option 1: Regular Farming

Letâ€™s say you have **100 USDT** and want to provide liquidity in the **stTON/USDT pool**:

* You first convert **50 USDT** into **8.33 stTON** (since 50 USDT Ã· 6 = 8.33 stTON).
* You then deposit **50 USDT** and **8.33 stTON** into the liquidity pool.
* The total value of your position is **100 USDT** (50 USDT + 50 USDT worth of stTON).
* The pool offers a **30% APR** as rewards for liquidity providers, meaning you would earn **30 USDT worth of TON** in rewards over the course of a year.

## Option 2: Leveraged Yield Farming (3x)

Now, letâ€™s compare with **leveraged yield farming** using the same **100 USDT**:

* Instead of converting part of your USDT, you deposit the full **100 USDT**.
* The system automatically **borrows 50 USDT** and **150 USDT worth of stTON** (25 stTON), giving you a total position of **300 USDT** (100 USDT + 50 USDT + 150 USDT worth of stTON).
* This gives you **3x leverage**, meaning you are now farming with **300 USDT** worth of assets.
* With the same **30% APR**, your reward would now be **90 USDT worth of TON** (since your total position is 300 USDT, 3 times larger than the regular farming position).

**However**, this isnâ€™t a **guaranteed profit**â€” leveraged yield farming comes with its own risks. In the next section, weâ€™ll explain the potential risks you need to be aware of before diving into leveraged yield farming.

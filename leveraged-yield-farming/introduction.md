**Leveraged Yield Farming** allows users to boost their farming returns by borrowing assets and farming with **up to 3x leverage**. With LYF, you can maximize your rewards by increasing your position in liquidity pools, potentially earning much higher yields compared to traditional farming. This strategy is ideal for users looking to amplify their profits while managing the additional risks associated with leveraging.

## Good Timing to Start Leveraged Yield Farming

Recently, the TON Foundation has been offering significant rewards to users providing liquidity to the stTON and tsTON pools on [STON.fi](http://ston.fi) and [DeDust.io](http://dedust.io) . These rewards will continue until the end of the year. Our team saw a growing need for a product that could help users take advantage of this. Thatâ€™s why we launched **Leveraged Yield Farming**, the first leverage yield farming on the TON.

Currently, we support pools on [DeDust.io](http://dedust.io/), specifically:

* [**tsTON/USDT Pool**](https://dedust.io/pools/EQBkh7Mc411WTYF0o085MtwJpYpvGhZOMBphhIFzEpzlVODp)
* [**stTON/USDT Pool**](https://dedust.io/pools/EQCm92zFBkLe\_qcFDp7WBvI6JFSDsm4WbDPvZ7xNd7nPL\_6M)

**Leveraged Yield Farming** is ideal for two types of users:

* **Stable Earners**: Those who want to earn stable interest by lending assets.
* **Risk-Takers**: Those who want to leverage for higher returns.

**Letâ€™s dive into how you can get started!**

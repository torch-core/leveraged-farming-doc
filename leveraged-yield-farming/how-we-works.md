In **Leveraged Yield Farming (LYF)**, there are two important roles:

* **Lenders** provide assets (like **USDT** or **tsTON**) to the **Lending Pool** and earn interest in return. Their role is low-risk and allows them to earn stable returns from lending out their assets.
* **Farmers** are the ones borrowing from the lending pool to **increase their farming position** and potentially earn higher returns using **leverage**.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Open position

1. **Borrow**: The **Farmer** borrows assets (like **USDT** or **tsTON**) from the **Lending Pool**, funded by Lenders, to increase their position in farming.
2. **Open Position**: The Farmer uses both the borrowed assets and their own capital to **provide liquidity** in a liquidity pool, creating a **Farm Position**.
3. **Provide Liquidity**: With the supplied assets, the Farmer participates in yield farming with a **3x leverage** strategy. This means the Farmer farms with three times the exposure to potential profits or losses.
4. **Farm 3x Revenue**: The leverage allows the Farmer to potentially **triple their rewards** from yield farming because they are farming with a larger position than they would have using only their own assets.

### Close Position

1. **Redeem & Claim Reward**: After a period of farming, the Farmer **redeems** their liquidity, **claims rewards** (like TON or other incentives), and **repays** the borrowed assets to the lending pool.
2. **Close Position**: Once the loan is fully repaid, the farming position is **closed**, and the remaining profits and rewards are returned to the Farmer.
